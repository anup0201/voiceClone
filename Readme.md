This Repo has a ipynb file that can be used to clone american voices with american accent using the tortoise-tts.

Run the notebook one code block at at time to setup the environment.

Before running the "Text to be spoken initialisation and laoding sample voice file" code block please place a recording file in wav format in a new folder under 
"tortoise-tts/tortoise/voices/{voice_name}" directory.

Cuda is required for this to run or else the inference will be very slow.
